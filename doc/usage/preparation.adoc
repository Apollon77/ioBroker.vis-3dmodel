= Preparation

While the widget can render the 3d content of GTLF files, these first need to be created, exported correctly and then setup in the widget. This chapter considers preparation tasks that need to be completed, before using the widget. 

== Creating a 3d model

There are multiple ways to generate a GLTF file, as there are exporters available for most widely used 3d-suites, including Blender, 3ds Max, Cinema4d and Maya.

This guide mainly focuses on Blender >= v2.8. Older versions of Blender can also be used, but from v2.8 on the GLTF exporter is included natively and showed the most promising results during tests.

As creating a sophisticated 3dmodel is no small task, it requires knowledge that cannot be taught within this documentation. Instead, this chapter focuses on aspects of the modeling process that are related to limitations of the widget and the 3D libraries it uses. The points described here center around modeling in Blender, but likely can be applied in some sense to other 3D-modeling tools as well.

Blender is a complex tool and with a good amount of know-how designers can create photo-realistic models and complex animations. But most of those effects are only possible, because professional 3D tools don't render sophisticated models in real-time and take up to minutes or hours depending on the complexity of scenes. Since this widget uses the link:https://threejs.org/[ThreeJS] library and the GLTF-format to render models in real time, it is safe to state that a lot of things that can be done with Blender simply won't work in this widget.

It is advised to take a close look at the link:[ThreeJS documentation], the link:https://threejs.org/examples[ThreeJS live examples], as well as the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0[GLTF specification] to get an idea, what is possible.

In addition, there are some personal findings during development:

* Complex Material Shaders are not supported (e.g. Glass BSDF). Simpler shaders (e.g. Principled BSDF) work fine though. So no realistic light refraction through glass, but textures can be made transparent.
* A lot of Modifiers (e.g. Boolean) don't make it into the final GLTF file, unless they are applied fully.
* GLTF animation support seems limited. Basic Mesh transformations (scale, rotate, position) work, but keyframes set to other object attributes (e.g. power-attribute for light-source) are apparently not supported.
* If in the 3d Model Widget shadow-rendering is enabled, there will be weird artifacts if link:https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.side[double-sided materials] are used. In Blender this can be avoided by activating "Backface Culling" for each material.
* If later in the 3d Model Widget textures are not rendered for the model:
** Check if normals are inverted (red in Blender with _Face Orientation_ activated in view") and fix them
** Unwrap textures in _UV editing_ mode to see if the then show up in GLTF.

Animations, if used, should be stored as separate NLA tracks in Blender with proper names, so they can be distiguished later in the widget. As mentioned, not all animations that can be implemented with Blender can be exported within the GLTF-file, only the ones based on simple transformations.

== Exporting the 3d model

The GLTF-export-dialog shown on the right hand side contains mostly the default values set by Blender. Make sure to use the right _Format_, to include _Punctual Lights_ (if you have lights in your model) and _Animations_ that are _Grouped by NLA Track_ (if you want to use animations).

Only *.gltf* files should be uploaded to VIS file-manager. At first glance it looks like *.glb* files can be uploaded as well, but when used the server does not deliver them correctly as the mime-type needed for it is not supported. However *.gltf* is basically just a large JSON-file and that can be served just fine.

It is a good idea to check the validity of your export GLTF-file, before using it in the widget. The publicly available link:https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/[online GLTF Viewer] provides an easy way to test any GLTF file you export. It is not in any way related to this widget and helps to distinguish between issues caused by the widget and issues as a result of export- or modeling-errors in your Blender project. Only if it works properly in such viewers, it will work flawlessly in the widget.
